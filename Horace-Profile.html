            <p> I honestly believe that my super power is the abilty to help others. I genuinely have a heart for people in which i'm constantly looking for ways to help someone else improve theirs. That may be by giving my testimony or helping them find resources that will encourgage, empower and enlighten them. </p>
            <p> I have previously completed this class but decided to retake this course to become better at this craft. I recently was apart of a Hack-a-thon for my current employee where I worked on the design, infrastructural layout and key word search for the application. Although my team and I won first place, I didnt feel confident enough to consider myself a professional. Wed design is not apart of my daily task for my current employer, but It definitely gives me an opportunity to expand with and possibly beyond my current employer. </p>
